# Course materials for ECON323 Spring 2022

Previous **programming experience** and classwork is useful, but **not required**.  We will also talk about the applications of the econometric and statistical learning methods.

We will follow the [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/) textbook

## Computational Setup

Installing software on your laptop is not mandatory. Instead,
- Go to the [QuantEcon DataScience](https://datascience.quantecon.org/) website and navigate to to notebook you want to use
- To import a lecture into UBC JupyterOpen, click the "launch notebook" icon in the top right corner, and enter: https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca as the private server
- See [Troubleshooting](https://datascience.quantecon.org/introduction/troubleshooting.html) for how to reset notebooks, etc.
- We strongly suggest creating a GitHub account and signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack/)

You are also encouraged to install Python (preferably Anaconda) on your machines.

If possible, please bring a laptop to class to interactively discuss the material.
